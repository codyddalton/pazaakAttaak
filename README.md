Pazaak is a card game from Star Wars which is similar to blackjack. The objective is to get as near to a score of 20 as possible without going over. You play against at least one other player trying to accomplish the same task. The player with the higher score at the end of the round wins that round. The first player to win three rounds wins the game. The twist is that each player also has a side deck of five cards. These cards can either increase or reduce one's total by the numerical amount listed on the card. A Pazaak player does not only strategize to stand or get a new card each turn, but also to choose and use their side deck effectively. <br></br>

<h2 align="center">How to Play Pazaak</h2>

<p align="justify">
  At the beginning of the game, each player selects ten(10) cards from their collection for their side deck. By randomized, impartial selection five(5) of each player's selected cards are placed in their respective side decks. The game begins with the first player being dealt their first card. Each card can have a value between one(1) and ten(10). This continues, one card at a time, for each player. As each player gets a new card, the sum total of their cards in play increases. As it approaches the golden number of twenty(20), they can choose to stand (receiving no more cards, staying at their current sum for this round) or to ask for another card. They can also use up to one card per turn from their side deck to increase or decrease their total before deciding whether to stand or continue. <br></br>

<p align="justify"><b>Win/Loss Conditions</b>:

* If a player goes over the sum of twenty(20) and they cannot reduce their total to twenty or below, they have gone bust. A player that has gone bust is not eligible to win the round, and in a game against one other player, the opponent wins the round automatically.

* Of all players that remain and have not gone bust, the player with the highest sum wins the round. If the highest sum is tied, the round is a draw and no wins are awarded.

* The first player to win three rounds wins the game.
